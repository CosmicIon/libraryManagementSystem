sooo a library management system ko ek library use karega... jo ki maan lo hoga ek librarian and a owner

soo lets say ki owner ke pass hoga all access and owner hi hoga jo ek library me books leke aayega 

our library management system will be used by the librarian or the library owner.
for owner
    -add books and its quantity.
    -remove useless books from the inventory.

for librarian
    -add users into the database.
    -remove users form the database.
    -check if the book is available or not.
    -check if user is defaulter or not.
    -mark student to defaulter.
    -borrow the book to the user.
    -take the return book from the user.

now we have to make the backend first... we will be having 3 class.. i.e.
1. user class
2. book class
3. library class
